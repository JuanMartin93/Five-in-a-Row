Five in a row
==============

[Five in a Row][] is a generalization of [Tic Tac Toe][] that is played
on a much larger grid. It requires players to get five marks in a row (instead
of three) to win.

A game of five in a row is played on an NxN grid (N is 9 by default in our
release code).  Players take turns placing their mark (an X or an O) in an
empty square.  A Player wins by placing five consecutive marks in any row,
column, or diagonal.
